Pyber Challenge Analysis
   
 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the ride share data by breaking it down into a      summarized pivot table to display results. Using the pivot table after cleaning up     the NAN values a line chart was created. The summarized table and line chart allows any shareholder to extract and analyze information in easier and more readable format. 

2.Results: Using images from the summary Data Frame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The results display that Urban city has more rides as compared to other cities which also correspond to having more driverâ€™s availability, but the fare rate less ($24.53) as compared to other (Rural $ 34.62 & Suburban $30.97). 


3. Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

a. As per the results it shows that fare rates are lower in Urban city as compared to the other two. More information should be needed to determine the overall earning on monthly and yearly for each driver. This will help understand if drivers are earning roughly same or there is a gap .

b. The fare rate should be broken down further to understand the tax inclusion and tips that contribute to the overall fare price. This can be used to understand if Urban city drivers are earning fairly, or they need to work more to make the same amount of money as other  cities drivers. This can be tied into a above as further analysis. 

c. A trend of drivers can be used to see travel between cities and how frequently.
